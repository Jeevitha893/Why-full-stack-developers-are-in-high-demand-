What is Full Stack Development?
Creating a website or web application's front-end and back-end parts at the same time is referred to as full-stack development.
The Frontend:
Direct user input occurs on the front end. Web pages and user interfaces are some of the things one can view on their screen. In front-end development, HTML is employed as the dominant technology to format web page content, CSS for styling the content's appearance, and JavaScript to make web pages interactive.
The Backend:
The server-side, or back-end, of an application is what users cannot see. Applications, servers, and databases are used to process and manage data in the background. This ensures that the user interface, or front-end, of a website functions well. Back-end developers might use programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, or JavaScript (Node.js). They also engage with databases to store, get, and change data.
